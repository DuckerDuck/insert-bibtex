# insert-bibtex 

This extension reads all `.bib` files in your workspace and allows you to reference the bibtex key or the title of the citations. 
I use this in combination with Foam extension for VS Code to keep track of papers I read using the bibtex key.

# Usage

In a text field write `bib:` and enter `alt-space` to insert a bib key, use `bibt:` to insert the title of the citation.
